### Clinical Information Data Format

We have several data format need to prepare to show the clinical information since the format for publication, data analysis and supplementary materials are dramatically differentially required. If clinical information is put as main table, you should prepare a summary format ([example](Table1.ESCC_Clinical_Epigenetics_Publication.docx)). if clinical information is put as supplmentary materials, you'd better so more details for the samples ([example](41586_2019_1272_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx)). Howwever, what's important, clinical information is deeply required for data analysis which require well-trimed format([example](DataAnalysis_Saminfo_Example.xlsx)).

2. How to prepare clinical information (Data analysis): [Excel format](DataAnalysis_Saminfo_Example.xlsx)
3. How to prepare clinical information (Main table): [Docx format](Table1.ESCC_Clinical_Epigenetics_Publication.docx)

5. Y2019-09-12: Cholangiocarcinoma methylation project (3 data type) [clinical sample information](Supplementary.xlsx)

### Best Way to Name the Sample:
* Control:  C001, C002, C003
* Disease:  D001, D002, D003
