### Clinical Information Data Format

We have several data format need to prepare to show the clinical information since the format for publication, data analysis and supplementary materials are dramatically differentially required. If clinical information is put as main table, you should prepare a summary format ([example](Table1.ESCC_Clinical_Epigenetics_Publication.docx)). if clinical information is put as supplmentary materials, you'd better so more details for the samples ([example](41586_2019_1272_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx)). Howwever, what's important, clinical information is deeply required for data analysis which require well-trimed format([example](DataAnalysis_Saminfo_Example.xlsx)).

### Best Way to Name the Sample:
* Control:  C001, C002, C003
* Disease:  D001, D002, D003

### IRB and informed consent:
On 15 April 2014, the study was reviewed and approved by the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute Institutional Review Board (FWA00000873, IRB00000673; title: Two Allele Loss of Function Genotype Array Study).

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All samples were collected following written informed consent. All investigators using the PMRP samples had obtained the Research Ethics and Compliance Training certification through the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) program. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Marshfield Clinic Institutional Review Board.
