## RNA-seq to Human Purulent samples from infected skin and soft tissues

* 2020/01/06: Data upload: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA599252&o=acc_s%3Aa
* Usage fastq-dump to download the fastq from SRA: https://ncbi.github.io/sra-tools/install_config.html
* How to download the fastq data (bash script): 
```bash
for i {64..87}
do
echo fastq-dump --split-spot SRR108387$i
done
```
Background: 
* 24 samples with paired-end RNA-seq
* Purulent samples are from infected human skin and soft tissues

Aim: 
* QC to fastq data (FastQC)
* mapping to microbe (genome and then use cDNA to obtain cdna matrix, S.aureus were thought to be main microbe)
* mapping to human (mRNA, any RNA-seq pipeline will be okay)

FYI:
* BA000033.2 and USA300 (CP000255.1) should be checked
