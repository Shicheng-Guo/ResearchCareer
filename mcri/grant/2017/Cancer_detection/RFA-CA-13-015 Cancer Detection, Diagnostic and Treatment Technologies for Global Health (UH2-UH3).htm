      <P class="regulartext">This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is a 
      new          initiative to support the development of cancer-relevant 
      technologies          suitable for use in low- and middle-income countries 
      (LMICs).&nbsp; Specifically,          the FOA solicits applications for 
      projects to adapt, apply, and validate          existing or emerging 
      technologies into a new generation of user-friendly, low-cost          
      devices or assays that are clinically comparable to currently used         
       technologies for imaging, in vitro detection/diagnosis, or treatment of   
             cancers in humans living in LMICs.</P>
      <P class="regulartext">Funds will be made available through the UH2/UH3 
      phased          innovation cooperative agreement award mechanism. 
      &nbsp;Applicants should have a          working assay or prototype (not 
      necessarily already capable of cancer          applications). &nbsp;The 
      initial 2-year (or shorter) UH2 exploratory phase will be          a 
      feasibility study to demonstrate technical functionality and clinical      
          potential for use in LMIC settings by meeting specific performance     
           milestones.&nbsp; UH2 projects that have met their milestones will be 
               administratively considered by NCI and prioritized for transition 
      to the UH3          validation phase.&nbsp; UH3 awards will support 
      improvements and validations of          the technologies in the LMIC 
      settings.&nbsp; The project period for the UH3 phase          is up to 3 
      years. &nbsp;Projects proposed in response to this FOA will require        
        multidisciplinary efforts to succeed and therefore all applicant teams 
      must          include expertise in engineering/assay/treatment 
      development, oncology,          global healthcare delivery, and business 
      development. &nbsp;Investigators          responding to this FOA must

<DIV class="heading4">Purpose</DIV>
<P class="regulartext">This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is a new    
initiative to support the development of cancer-relevant technologies suitable   
 for use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).&nbsp; Specifically, the 
FOA    solicits applications for projects to adapt, apply, and validate existing 
or    emerging technologies into a new generation of user-friendly, low-cost 
devices    or assays that are clinically comparable to currently used 
technologies for    cancer imaging, in vitro detection/diagnosis, or treatment 
of cancers treatable    in persons living in LMICs.</P>
<P class="regulartext">Under the UH2/UH3 phased innovation cooperative agreement 
   award mechanism, applicants responding to this FOA must address both the UH2  
  exploratory phase and UH3 validation phase. &nbsp;The UH2 phase is a 
feasibility    study to demonstrate technical functionality and clinical 
potential of the    technology/assay/device/treatment for use in LMIC settings 
by meeting specific    performance milestones. &nbsp;The most promising projects 
will be selected for the    UH3 phase for clinical validation.</P>
<P class="regulartext">Projects proposed in response to this FOA will require    
multidisciplinary efforts to succeed, and, therefore, all applicant teams must   
 include expertise in engineering/assay/treatment development, oncology, global  
  healthcare delivery, and business development.</P>
<DIV class="heading4">Background</DIV>
<P class="regulartext">It is estimated that nearly two-thirds of the 7.6 million 
annual    cancer deaths in the world occur in LMICs.&nbsp; Furthermore, the 
incidence rate of    cancer is on the rise in populations of many LMICs, with 
substantial    inequalities in cancer survival rates across the world.&nbsp; 
Access to cancer    prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis, and treatment 
are significant    challenges in many LMICs, especially in rural areas with 
limited    infrastructure.</P>
<P class="regulartext">Recently developed technologies, such as lab-on-a-chip,   
 mobile health (mHealth), cryotherapy, biosensors, imaging, and spectroscopy,    
appear to have potential for use in LMICs, and recent developments in consumer   
 electronics, microfabrication, cellular phone communications, and hand-held    
computers further improve their prospects for adaptation into sensitive, 
low-cost    versions suitable for use in remote locations.</P>
<P class="regulartext">While many types of cancer are currently not treatable in 
   low resource settings, success has been reported for some cancers, such as    
Hodgkin lymphoma, even in the least developed countries. &nbsp;Cancers that are  
  amenable to prevention, early detection, and treatment in LMICs include those  
  associated with HPV infection, leukemia, lymphomas, and hepatocellular,    
cervical, oral-pharyngeal, breast, and colorectal cancers. &nbsp;While treatment 
of    cancer in LMICs is challenging, those treatments that are minimally 
invasive    have higher likelihood to yield successful outcomes. &nbsp;Treatment 
is also more    likely to succeed if the cancer is detected early and still 
localized. &nbsp;Furthermore,    relatively low-cost therapies such as surgery, 
cryotherapy, or generic drugs may    suffice for cancers that are localized and 
detected early.&nbsp; However, early    treatment depends on effective 
technologies for early detection and diagnosis.&nbsp;    Most available 
technologies for cancer are not suitable for use in low resource    settings due 
to expense, dependency on extensive medical infrastructure, or    both. 
&nbsp;Various portable technologies and minimally invasive diagnostic and    
treatment methods exist that might be suitable for low resources settings. 
&nbsp;However,    there is a paucity of data on the application and 
effectiveness of such    approaches. &nbsp;This situation warrants translational 
efforts to develop    appropriate technologies that could help improve treatment 
of cancers in    resource-poor settings. </P>
<DIV class="heading4">Research Objectives</DIV>
<P class="regulartext">Applications in response to this FOA must propose to 
adapt,    apply, engineer, and validate existing or emerging technologies or 
assays into    a new generation of technologies and assays for detection, 
imaging, in vitro    diagnosis, or treatment of cancers treatable in an 
LMIC.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>      Adaptation: Modification of an existing assay or device such that    
    it can be used for the detection or treatment of cancer.</LI>
  <LI>      Engineering: Simplification or addition of new features to a      
  device or assay to enable the device to operate outside a lab in an LMIC, 
  e.g.,      areas in which the people have limited access to electricity.</LI>
  <LI>      Applying existing or emerging technologies that have not been      
  previously used for cancer or used in LMICs.</LI>
  <LI>Validation: Validate the analytical and clinical performance of      the 
  device or assay to detect or treat a specific cancer in an LMIC.</LI></UL>
<P class="regulartext"><STRONG><EM>Scope</EM></STRONG></P>
<P class="regulartext">The project must focus on a specific cancer type that is 
treatable    in the proposed LMIC setting and must show promise to deliver 
medical utility    for improved health outcomes. &nbsp;Suitable 
technologies/devices/assays/treatments to    be proposed for 
development/adaptation must be based on a working prototype    (for new 
technologies) or an existing device (which will serve as a basis for    
adaptation) demonstrating a general feasibility of the proposed approaches. 
&nbsp;The    demonstration of their usability for a chosen cancer is not a 
prerequisite for    application. &nbsp;After the implementation, the proposed 
technologies/devices are    expected to provide tools that are clinically 
comparable to existing    established technologies/devices/assays/treatments in 
clinical practice. The    technology must comply with the applicable regulations 
and international    standards/guidelines [such as Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP), Good    Manufacturing Practice (GMP), WHO guidelines, FDA 
Investigational<EM> New Drug</EM>&nbsp;(<EM>IND), FDA Investigational Device    
Exemption</EM>&nbsp;(<EM>IDE</EM>)&nbsp;or    local regulations in LMICs].</P>
<P class="regulartext"><STRONG><EM>Relevant technologies include but are not

<UL>
  <LI><EM>In vitro</EM> diagnostic assays or technologies: Point-of-Care 
  analytical tools for complex      samples such as blood, saliva, or urine 
  (e.g., lab-on-a-chip and biosensors      that allow the performance of 
  relevant chemical and/or biological assays      outside of laboratory 
  environments). </LI>
  <LI>      Imaging technologies for cancer detection/diagnosis, e.g., optical   
     imaging, spectroscopy, and ultrasound. </LI>
  <LI>Treatment-related technologies:&nbsp;any type of treatment      modality 
  as well as technologies/devices that may aid/facilitate standard      
  treatment modalities.&nbsp; In particular tools for various potentially 
  portable      minimally invasive treatment&nbsp;methods are appropriate, 
  including, but not      limited to surgical devices, technologies related to 
  drugs/vaccines/chemotherapy/immunotherapy,      tools for cryotherapy laser 
  therapy, radiofrequency ablation, low-power-density      sonication, 
  high-intensity focused ultrasound, and photodynamic&nbsp;therapy. </LI></UL>
<P class="regulartext"><STRONG><EM>General Technology

<P class="regulartext">Prior to funding, the NCI Project Scientist will contact 
the    UH2 applicants to discuss the proposed UH2 and UH3 milestones and any 
changes    suggested by NIH staff or the NIH review panel.&nbsp; The Program 
Official and    the applicant will negotiate and agree on a final set of 
approved UH2    performance targets and milestones which will be specified in 
the Notice of    Award.&nbsp; These milestones will assist the review for 
determining successful    completion of the work proposed in the UH2 stage and

 UH3 stage, an updated human subject's protection plan (e.g., protocol    
amendment, IRB approval of amendments to the protocol or consent form, etc.)    
and a detailed data and safety monitoring plan (DSMP) if appropriate, must be    
approved by NIH.&nbsp; Receipt of this progress report will trigger an    
administrative program review that will determine whether or not the UH3 should  
  be awarded. </P>
<P class="regulartext">The release of UH3 funds will be based on successful    
completion of the approved scientific milestones, program priorities, and the    
availability of funds. <BR><BR>    A formal notification in the form of a Notice 
of Award (NoA) will be provided    to the applicant organization for successful

<P class="Heading4">Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions of Award</P>
<P class="regulartext">The following special terms of award are in addition to, 
and    not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB)    administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS)    grant administration regulations at 45 CFR Parts 74 and 92 (Part 92 is  
  applicable when State and local Governments are eligible to apply), and other  
  HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies. <BR><BR>    The 
administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the    
cooperative agreement, an "assistance" mechanism (rather than an    
"acquisition" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic    involvement 
with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the    activities. 
&nbsp;Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and    
stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working    
jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume    
direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. 
&nbsp;Consistent    with this concept, the dominant role and prime 
responsibility resides with the    awardees for the project as a whole, although 
specific tasks and activities may    be shared among the awardees and the NIH as 
defined below. <BR><BR><STRONG>The  PD(s)/PI(s) will have the primary 
responsibility for:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
  <LI>      Defining the overall research objectives and approaches of the 
  consortium; </LI>
  <LI>Determining experimental approaches, designing protocols, setting      
  project milestones, and overseeing the conduct of experiments; </LI>
  <LI>Overseeing and coordinating the effort of the multi-disciplinary      team 
  and participating institutions and ensuring their optimal integration;</LI>
  <LI>Overseeing the conduct of UH2/UH3 research projects and ensuring      
  their scientific rigor; </LI>
  <LI>Ensuring compliance with the applicable mandatory regulations      
  (including protection of human subjects) in the U.S. and an LMIC as required 
  by      specific research activities; </LI>
  <LI>Adhering to the NIH policies regarding intellectual property,      data 
  release, and other policies that might be established during the course of     
   this activity; </LI>
  <LI>Submitting twice a year during the UH2 phase and quarterly during      the 
  UH3 phase updates on progress and problems in a brief format as agreed upon    
    with the NCI; </LI>
  <LI>Submitting monthly updates on human subject and accrual reports      upon

<P class="regulartext"><STRONG>NIH    staff will have substantial programmatic 
involvement that is above and beyond    the normal stewardship role in awards, 
as described below:</STRONG></P>
<P class="regulartext">An NCI Program staff member(s) acting as a Project    
Scientist(s) will have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and    
beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below. Additional    
NCI staff members may be designated to have substantial involvement. The NCI 
Project    Scientist(s) and any other substantially involved staff members will 
not attend    peer review meetings of renewal (competing continuation) and/or 
supplemental    applications. If such participation is deemed essential, these 
individuals will    seek NCI waiver according to the NCI procedures for 
management of conflict of    interest.</P>
<P class="regulartext">Additionally, an NCI Program Official will be responsible 
   for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will 
be    named in the award notice. Some Program Officials may also have 
substantial    programmatic involvement (as Project Scientists/Coordinators). In 
that case,    the individual involved will not attend peer review meetings of 
renewal    (competing continuation) and/or supplemental applications or will 
seek NCI    waiver as stated above.</P>
<P class="regulartext">The main activities of the NCI substantially involved 
staff    members include but are not limited to the following aspects:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Providing input on experimental and clinical approaches,      assisting in 
  designing protocols, and consulting on updates to project      
milestones;</LI>
  <LI>Providing advice to the awardees on specific scientific,      analytical,

  <LI>      Monitoring progress of the projects towards meeting milestones      
  and adherence to the strategic goals of the program;</LI>
  <LI>Tracking monthly accrual of participants for clinical testing to      
  ensure proper completion of this essential step;</LI>
  <LI>Participating in the activities of the Steering Committee and the      
  implementation of its guidelines and procedures;</LI>
  <LI>Stimulating interactions among awardees;</LI>
  <LI>Attending annual Steering Committee meetings organized by the      NCI;

individual award, including the UH3 phase, if there is insufficient progress    
towards meeting milestones.</P>
<P class="regulartext"><STRONG>Areas    of Joint Responsibility</STRONG></P>
<P class="regulartext">Steering Committee:</P>
<P class="regulartext">The awardees funded under this FOA will form a Steering   
 Committee.&nbsp; </P>
<P class="regulartext">The Steering Committee will consist of the following 
voting    members:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>PDs/PIs from each cooperative agreement UH2/UH3 award (one vote per      
  award even when multiple PDs/PIs are designated); and</LI>
  <LI>NCI-assigned Project Scientists, a representative from the NCI      Center 
  for Global Health, and a representative from the NCI SBIR Development Center,

<P class="regulartext">The Committee will be chaired by one of the UH2/UH3 
PDs/PIs.</P>
<P class="regulartext">Other NIH staff members may participate in the activities 
of    the Committee as needed as non-voting members.</P>
<P class="regulartext">The Steering Committee will be responsible for 
communication    and coordination among funded projects, including sharing 
ideas, logistics, and    solutions to technical issues. &nbsp;When feasible and 
appropriate, the Steering    Committee will seek to establish consensus on 
platform interoperability in    areas such as control software, data analysis, 
communication protocols, and    standard power sources. &nbsp;Other shared 
advice may include promise of clinical potential,    manufacturability, 
regulatory issues, and deployment into local resource    limited settings. The 
members of the Steering Committee will meet once a year    in person and by 
conference calls as needed.</P>
<P class="regulartext">Panel of External Scientific Consultants:&nbsp; </P>
<P class="regulartext">Panel of External Scientific Consultants will operate as 
a    subcommittee to the Steering Committee, advising the Steering Committee and 
   providing technical expertise to awardees. The members of the panel will be   
 selected by NCI in consultation with the UH2/UH3 awardees to provide    
independent assessments and recommendations to awardees on the progress. The 
panel    will consist of scientists with relevant expertise who are not 
participants in    any of the cooperative agreement awards resulting from this 
FOA. The ESC will    meet once a year. Part of this meeting may be in 
conjunction with the Steering    Committee meeting to allow members of both 
groups to interact directly with    each other. </P>
<P class="regulartext"><STRONG>Dispute    Resolution:</STRONG></P>
<P class="regulartext">Any disagreements that may arise in scientific and/or    
programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients    
and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel    
composed of three members will be convened. It will have three members: a    
designee of the Steering Committee chosen without NIH staff voting; one NIH    
designee; and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is    
chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first    
member may be chosen by the individual awardee. This special dispute resolution  
  procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that  
  is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50,    
Subpart D and HHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16.</P>
