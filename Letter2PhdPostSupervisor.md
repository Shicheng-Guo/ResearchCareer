Dear Professor Jin,

I am currently applying for the tenure track assistant professor positions at the Center for Human Genomics and Precision Medicine in UW-Madison. It is a new center opened in 2017 and now they are having cluster hiring and two-positions of them are quite fitting me. I was wondering if you were able to write a strong recommendation letter for my application.

In this position, I will focus on two works: 

1) Identifying and implementing detection of circulating cell-free DNA-based genetic and epigenetic biomarkers for early diagnosis, real-time monitoring and prognosis prediction; 

2) Functional assessment of the genetic and epigenetic variants identified by GWAS, pheWAS, EWAS studies;
I would be extremely grateful if I can receive your support and the deadline is 2019/09/01. I have attached all the materials which you might need to revise the reference including cover letter, statement of research interest. UW-Madison human resource will contact you to request the recommendation letter. You can also send the recommendation letter directly to Cody Roekle and Stephen Meyn. 

Cody Roekle, croekle@wisc.edu
Stephen Meyn, stephen.meyn@wisc.edu
Best,
