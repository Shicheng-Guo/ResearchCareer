1. How to prepare a good cover letter
* A faculty cover letter introduces you to future colleagues and demonstrates your confidence, innovation, and passion as a scientist and educator. It clearly explains how your expertise, values, and goals align with the department and university, and identifies your niche in your future academic community--Sara Garamszegi
* The purpose of a cover letter is to introduce yourself and to demonstrate the fit between your background and the advertised position. 
* Colleges will typically want to hire new faculty who are passionate about their current research and not resting on past research credits.
* Articulate your fit and focus on potential contributions to this institutionâ€”not why you need or want the job and Show enthusiasm for the position.
* Include a thesis statement outlining the reasons why you are applying for this job and what makes you an excellent candidate.
