**News, Views and Commentaries** are by prior arrangement. They may be linked to articles of exceptional significance that are published in our journal or elsewhere. Solicited news, views and commentaries are invited by Editor-In-Chief. However, unsolicited contributions are also highly welcomed. News, Views and Commentaries are focusing on most recent high-impact and cutting-edge basic researches and clinical trials to accelerate the research and corresponding clinical applications. **News, Views and Commentaries** usually required to be less than one page and allowed to have one Figure or one Table.

As a guideline, Commentary allow up to 10 references and article titles are omitted from the reference list.

Our aim is to make News, Views and Commentaries enhance the discussion to most recent exciting  genetic medicine & precision medicine & gene therapy to advance the understanding to the clinical significance for the bench research and clinical trials.
