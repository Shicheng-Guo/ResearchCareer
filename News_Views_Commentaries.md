### News_Views_Commentaries

News, Views and Commentaries are by prior arrangement. They may be linked to articles of exceptional significance that are published in our journal or elsewhere. Solicited news, views and commentaries are invited by Editor-In-Chief. However, unsolicited contributions are also highly welcomed. News, Views and Commentaries are focusing on most recent high-impact and cutting-edge basic researches and clinical trials to accelerate the research and corresponding clinical applications. News and Views usually required to be less than one page with one Figure or one Table. Commentaries do not normally contain primary raw research data, although they may present sociological and re-analysis to published data (funding trends, demographics, bibliographic data, and re-analyzed data or figure). As a guideline, Commentary allow up to 10 references and article titles are omitted from the reference list. Commentaries will be reviewed by the Editor-In-Chief and may be peer reviewed at the editors' discretion. Our aim is to make News, Views and Commentaries enhance the understanding to the clinical significance for the bench research and clinical trials.
