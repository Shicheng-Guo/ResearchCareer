* 应该列举自己所有的项目的进展和时间表.
* 每次会议都要有落实，必须给出所有任务的具体的时间表.
* 自己的工作的性质要明确，你support的工作是哪些（就是你仅仅是帮忙的项目，这个项目不是你的，你只是在其中帮忙做点东西而已，发表时你只是众多author中的一员），你develop的工作是哪些（这个是你自己的项目，你自己明白aim和method，你自己要collect数据，以及分析数据产生最后的结果，并撰写论文，发表时你是第一作者），你负责lead和manage的工作是哪些（如果一个项目需要好几个环节才能完成，也就是说需要好几个人负责帮忙，那么你需要进行安排和领导，控制进度，对数据质量进行评估，以及负责项目的整体推动和文章撰写）.

* Scientist 1 is an entry level position. He/She is a capable individual with credentials but probably someone who is fresh out of academics. Their theoretical concepts are accurate but they don’t really have real world experience to realize the gaps in their knowledge with respect to real world constraints and they don’t how to deal with them.

* Scientist 2 is someone who has bridged the gap between theory and practice. They are familiar with real world issues and have a handle on them. This person is still focussed on problems within their expertise though. Their influence their personal productivity or the productivity of a 1–3 other Scientist 1/2 on their team.

* Senior scientist is someone who is able to handle problems outside of primary expertise. This “problems” depend on the organization. It can mean people issues, coordination between teams, etc. Their sphere of influence has expanded beyond improving their personal productivity to a group of Scientists.

* Principal Scientist is someone who isn’t merely getting the work done. Instead their productivity has evolved to organization development, long term charter, they are expected to get the business impact right, and should be identifying and driving the right problems at the organization level.
