Questions for trivia:

1.	Q: What does F&A stand for?

A: "F&A" stands for Facilities and Administrative, and the term is used interchangeably with "indirect costs" or "overhead." F&A costs support research infrastructure.

F&A costs are incurred for support of office space, building services/facilities and administrative management. Examples of F&A costs: utility costs, costs of operating and maintaining facilities, computers and laptops and the cost of general administration of the organization – mail services, human resources, business services, etc.

F&A is defined in Uniform Guidance §200.56 as "those costs incurred for a common or joint purpose benefitting more than one cost objective, and not readily assignable to the cost objectives specifically benefitted, without effort disproportionate to the results achieved." 


2.	Q: Who within MCRI is authorized to submit a final proposal to a potential funder?

A: Your friendly and knowledgeable Sponsored Programs Grant and Contract Specialists and Budget and Contract Specialist have this authorization.  


3.	Q: What document do I need to sign if I am a PI?

A: Actually there are numerous documents:
PI Responsibility
Internal Routing
Subrecipient Determinant Questionnaire (if a Subrecipient is involved)


4.	Q: TRUE or FALSE: Biosketches do not need to be updated very often.

A: False! Biosketches should be revised with each new grant submission. 
Each proposal submission requires a customized biosketch.  In addition, Sponsors, like NIH, have a format requirement. It is important to pay attention to biosketch rules.


5.	Q: What is needed before project teams can begin spending on a new project award?

A: An activity number allows expenditures to be processed at MCHS.  Activity numbers are established once the award has been received and processed, OR once the research center has requested an activity number prior to award.  MCRI policy requires Sponsored Programs accept awards on behalf of the Institute. If an award comes to Sponsored Programs, we will send you a copy of the agreement after it has been fully executed by the Sponsor and MCRI. If the award needs to be reviewed and/or modified, you will receive communication from Sponsored Programs post award staff indicating areas of concern and identifying award sections that require PI review and approval. You may receive the award directly from the Sponsor. If you do, route the award to Sponsored Programs so that we can review and sign the award, as required, and have Sponsored Programs set up your account number. If a proposal was not routed for the award, it should be completed prior to signature and project set up.  


6.	Q: What is the name of the Marshfield Clinic Health System’s peer-reviewed Journal?

A: Clinical Medicine & Research


7.	Q: ORSS hosts monthly get-togethers to present research administration related topics of interest to research staff.  What are those events called?

A: ORSS Coffee Breaks. Next one is October 10!


8.	Q: What does the Institutional Review Board do?

A: An IRB is a group of individuals who are responsible for reviewing a research study to make sure that the research participant’s rights and welfare are protected. Lots of information about IRB can be found on the ORSS Intranet site that can be found on the HUB. 


9.	Q: If a grant-funded project lists Marshfield Clinic as the Prime recipient and there is a sub recipient on the project, do we need any documentation for that arrangement?

A: Oh yes! That’s called a Sub Recipient arrangement and Sponsored Programs does have documentation that must be signed by all parties involved. This is a very important part of finalizing an agreement between two entities working together on a grant. 


10.	Q: If you get sponsored funding, do you acknowledge the sponsor on publications and presentations?

A: Yes. Industry Sponsored projects will likely have an agreement in place about it, but grants should always be acknowledged.  


11.	What is the definition of a reasonable cost? 
A cost is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to incur the cost. The question of is the cost reasonable, allocable, and applicable should be asked.
12.	What must be done if the sponsors determines a cost is unallowable? 
The cost of the item determined unallowable must be reimbursed to the federal government in full along with interest. 
13.	MCRI follows a MTDC (Modified Total Direct Cost) when calculating indirect costs. Under this method, name at least 3 expense categories that we cannot collect our 60% F&A rate on. 
Equipment (costs over $5K), Capital Expenditures, patient care charges, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships, fellowships, participant support costs.
