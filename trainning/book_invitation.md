Dear Dr. Shicheng Guo, 

This is Jamuna, Editorial Manager at Vide Leaf, an eBook publication Start-Up. 

I came across your publication “Identification of Hyper-Methylated Tumor Suppressor Genes-Based Diagnostic Panel for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) in a Chinese Han Population” published in “Frontiers in Genetics” and would like to discuss the possibility of republishing it as a Book chapter in our eBook by crediting the original source. 

The copyright License of the journal in which the article was published permits for such republication. 

eBook Title: Prime Archives in Genetics 
Mode of Publication: Digital (Open Access) 
Indexing: Google Books 
ISBN and DOI: Assigned 
Publication Fee charged from authors: USD 250 

Kindly let us know if you will be interested in the above proposal so that I could share further details accordingly. 

Look forward to hearing from you. 

Regards, 
Jamuna
