* Commentaries are short, narrowly focused articles that are usually commissioned by the journal. These articles are generally not peer-reviewed. A Commentary generally takes one of two forms:
* The first form aims to highlight one or more exciting research articles or clinical trials recently published in BMC Medicine or another journal, to discuss specific issues within a subject area rather than the whole field, and to explain the clinical implications of the article to place the new findings into context. Opinions are welcome as long as they are factually based.
* The second form is more editorial in nature and covers an aspect of an issue that is relevant to the journal's scope. Examples of this type of Commentary could be a discussion of the impact of new technology on research and treatment, or a discussion of changes in peer review or grant application procedures and their effect on research. By their nature, the second form of Commentary is less frequent. Commentaries are usually commissioned from recognized experts in a particular field, and authors are asked to provide a balanced overview of the field, to cover only work that has been published (or is still in press at the time of writing), and not to discuss and cite primarily their own work or that of their close colleagues.
* Commentaries should be a maximum of 1000 words and have a maximum of ten references. Typically, Commentaries do not contain figures or tables.
